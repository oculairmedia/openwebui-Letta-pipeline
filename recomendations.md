Okay, I understand you need the report now. Here's a summary of my findings and recommendations for fixing the integration:

Current Limitations:

The existing pipeline (async_lettapipeline.pyCopy Code
) is primarily designed to handle message content using the 'send_message' tool within a 'tool_call_message'.
It does not process other types of tool calls or function calls from OpenWebUI.
The pipeline uses a polling mechanism, which might not be the most efficient way to handle real-time events or callbacks.
OpenWebUI Tool and Function Handling:

OpenWebUI manages tools via a dedicated 'tools' router in the backend.
It supports user-defined tools with configurations (valves).
There is also support for Python function calling, and these function definitions exist in a 'functions' router and are also loaded by the backend.
OpenWebUI has an API for interacting with tools (including creation, updates, deletion etc) and they are persisted in a database.
OpenWebUI handles access control using different user roles.
Recommendations for Enhancing the Integration:

Expand Tool Call Processing:

Modify the _process_messagesCopy Code
 method in async_lettapipeline.pyCopy Code
 to extract and handle various tool call types, not just send_messageCopy Code
. This requires inspecting the tool's name and arguments and then performing the appropriate action.
Implement logic to handle different tool call structures and formats, rather than assuming they are always send_messageCopy Code
 calls.
Support Function Calls:

Add specific handlers for function calls that can execute Python code or make external API requests based on the function call's definition. This might involve creating a lookup to map function names to their corresponding execution logic or using a generic way to execute functions by extracting the information from the request.
Implement a More Robust Polling Mechanism:

For a real-time system, consider using a better approach to listening to events rather than polling, such as Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets. This may involve switching away from using httpx, to an alternative that supports event based communication, or setting up a different endpoint to listen to events.
If using polling, implement exponential backoff with jitter on error conditions to avoid overloading the server, and make sure the polling frequency is configurable.
Dynamic Tool Handling:

The pipeline should be able to dynamically load and use new tool definitions from OpenWebUI by querying the tool API and loading the relevant module at runtime, rather than being hardcoded.
Tools should also be loaded with correct UserValves, so they can be configured by the user.
Error Handling:

Enhance the error handling to provide specific messages for different types of errors including connection, JSON parsing, and execution errors, rather than just a generic error message.
These recommendations should help to improve the integration and expand the pipeline to support more than just message processing. Let me know if you have any other questions.
